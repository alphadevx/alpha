INTRODUCTION
============

svn2cl is a simple xsl transformation and shellscript wrapper for generating a
classic GNU-style ChangeLog from a subversion repository log. It is made from
several changelog-like scripts using common xslt constructs found in different
places.

I made it because it was the only thing that I missed from cvs after I
converted a repository to subversion. I used cvs2cl before. 

INSTALLING SVN2CL
=================

Just unpack the tarball in some directory (e.g. /opt/svn2cl-0.7)
and symlink the svn2cl.sh script in your path somewhere (e.g.
ln -s /opt/svn2cl-0.7/svn2cl.sh /usr/local/bin/svn2cl).

Note: Be sure to keep the svn2cl.xsl file in the same directory as the
svn2cl.sh script as the script looks for it there (symlinking is ok).

NOTES
=====

The log is performed on the current directory `.' unless you specify URL
and/or PATH parameters. Before generating the ChangeLog you may want to make
your working copy up to date with `svn update' (non-recursive update will do)
or pass --revision HEAD:1 as a parameter to svn2cl.sh.

There will not be very frequent new releases but if there are they can be
found at: http://ch.tudelft.nl/~arthur/svn2cl/
