# tmhOAuth

An OAuth 1.0A library written in PHP by @themattharris, specifically for use
with the Twitter API.

**Important**: If you used custom HTTP request headers they should now be defined
as `'key' => 'value'` pairs instead of complete `'key: value'` strings.

If you previously used version 0.4 be aware the utility functions
have now been broken into their own file. Before you use version 0.5+ in your app
test locally to ensure your code doesn't need tmhUtilities included.

**Disclaimer**: This project is a work in progress. Please use the issue tracker
to report any enhancements or issues you encounter.

## Goals

- Support OAuth 1.0A
- Use Authorisation headers instead of query string or POST parameters
- Allow uploading of images
- Provide enough information to assist with debugging

## Dependancies

The library has been tested with PHP 5.3+ and relies on CURL and hash_hmac. The
vast majority of hosting providers include these libraries and run with PHP 5.1+.

The code makes use of hash_hmac, which was introduced in PHP 5.1.2. If you version
of PHP is lower than this you should ask your hosting provider for an update.

## Usage

This will be built out later but for the moment review the examples for ways
the library can be used. Each example contains instructions on how to use it
